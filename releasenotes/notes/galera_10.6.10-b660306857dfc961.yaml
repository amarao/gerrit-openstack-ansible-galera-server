    Default MariaDB version is set to 10.6.10. When running minor upgrade
    don't forget to provide ``-e galera_upgrade=true`` to openstack-ansible
    command.
    With that MariDB version installed for CentOS 9 Stream, Rocky 9 and Ubuntu
    22.04 will switch from distro provided version to 10.6.10 installed from
    MariaDB repository, which might be a major version upgrade.
